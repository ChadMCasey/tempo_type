# TempoType

TempoType is a speed typing test & small side project of mine involving HTML, CSS and JS. This project was not only a blast to make but also very developmental in terms of helping me refine my algorithmic thinking skills. 
Particularly tricky in this application was developing a cursor. Moreover, correctly traversing the underlying array representation of the characters & words displayed within the text area of the typing test, was also quite the challenge. 

## Technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
